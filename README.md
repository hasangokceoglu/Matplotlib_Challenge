# Matplotlib_Challenge

In this challenge Pymaceuticals, Inc. data on potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer analysed.

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Based on the several analysis, here are the main outcomes of the study

Capomulin and Ramicane are top 2 tested regiments on mice

Male and female mice ratios are close to each other as 51%-49%

After using Capomulin and Ramicane, final tumor sizes are lower compared to other treatments which means they are more effective then others.

Capomulin effect on mouse l509 over the time period is reduce tumor size.

There is a correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume as correlation result is 0.84 which means when the mouse weight higher, the average tumor volume also increase.
